GiftedMotion
============

Introduction
============

This simply is a "better version" of the old GiftedMotion animator program, created by OnyxBits. 

Eventually this'll develop into more of a "Version 2.0" of GiftedMotion, through slow additions. I think the ultimate goal is to create an applet version and perhaps specialize the software to "Gif Stabilizations" that have become popular on reddit, since an onionskin feature + rotation is much easier to do in GiftedMotion than anything else I've found that's also free.

Differences than Vanilla Version
=================

* Windows can't float away, forever unusable
* Buttons are more accurately disabled/enabled based on state
* Resources file edited to be more logical. I think OnyxBits is German.
* Removed crufy languages that really aren't necessary.
* Fixed annoying bug in the sequence editor
* Added drag-n-drop from the filesystem
* Added a tool system
* Rotate tool
* Resize tool
* Image deoptimizer
* Crippledly loads malformed gifs, whereas the original doesn't at all
* Onionskinner (userful for creating stabilizations)
* More things that I've forgotten.
